##### Updated 07/11/2020

I updated all of the code to work with the latest spec which does not include HTML imports. I have left all of the html file versions of the components alongside the new js component files for comparison.

example: `repeat-tag.html -> repeat-tag.js`

##### Updated 05/12/2025

switched swapi url.  will probably need to do this again.
